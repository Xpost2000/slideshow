               A stupid slideshow program in Rust,
               Yeah as of this version there's no layout
               or alignment, so it's done by hand :(

                               (Don't like typing? Ask a friend to code a WYSIWYG editor :))
                               (easy commands! $reset, $background-color, basically whatever you see as css?)

            - It's made in *Rust.*
            - It's also a lightweight tool
            - +Start typing to produce complete trash+
            - I mean really cool looking slides like me!
            - Also hot-reloadable slides!
